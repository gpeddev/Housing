Individual Project

Imagine that you are a data analytics consultant for a firm who wants to get projected 
sale price of houses from house sale advertisements currently in the market, ignoring 
their asking price. The housing data (housing.csv) collected by the firm includes 500 sales 
in the last six months and include the variables. The last column is the outcome variable.

    elevation: Elevation of the base of the house

    dist_am1: Distance to Amenity 1

    dist_am2: Distance to Amenity 2

    dist_am3: Distance to Amenity 3

    bath: Number of bathrooms

    sqft: Square footage of the house

    parking: Parking type 
        "Not Provided" => parking is not provided as part of the house but street parking may be available
        "No Parking"=> Parking is not available near the house.
        You may also choose to merge the above two categories to a single "Parking not available" category

    precip: Amount of precipitation

    price: Final House Sale Price

Now develop the best possible linear regression model to predict the house sale price using the variables
using the techniques that you have learnt in this course. Interpret the variables included and provide 
explanation for your choice of best model.
